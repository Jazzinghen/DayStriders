## GLSL Raymarcher and Qt Node Compositor

![alt text](/assets/images/GLSL_Raymarcher_Screenshot.jpg "GLSL Raymarcher screenshot")

A joint project for both "Computer Graphics - Introduction" and "Rendering -
Introduction" courses I attended at Technical University of Denmark. Did it together
with Nicolas Silva, while we both worked on everything, I focused on the raytracer
implementation in OpenGL and GLSL, while he focused in the integration of a node-base
effect editor.

[Here is the source code][1]

## "BROFist: Robot Operational Fistbumps"

"BROFist: Robot Operational Fistbumps" was my Bachelor's final project. It was a project
to allow direct connection between a didactical Lego NXT robot running a NXTOSEK-based
server and [SciCosLab][2]. This allowed for graphical system modeling and prototyping
by creating a live bidirectional connection to the robot. It was used in the Master's
course "Laboratory of Embedded Control Systems" for two years in a row (they changed
the hardware platform after that period).

Here are the [project code][3] and the [report sources][4].

## "Project Xeresia" and "600 bucks per second"

Two 50000+ words novels I have written for [NaNoWriMo][5] 2010 and 2011. They are
fantasy/sci-fantasy novels where I tried to write some "shounen-y" stories without
banal characters and character interactions. I don't know if I managed. But I managed
to keep up with the strict deadlines in place during the NaNoWriMo event.

The first one, "Project Xersia", was completed only in theory, as I managed to write
more than 50k words, but in practice the story was far from complete. Learning from this
experience, the next year, I wrote "600 bucks per second", managing not only to write
more than 60k words, but also managing to put the word end to that story.

It was a very exciting experience.

You can find both novels (in Italian) on their [GitHub repo][6].

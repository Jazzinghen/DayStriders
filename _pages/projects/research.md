## "GaitAnimator"

![alt text](/assets/images/GaitAnimator_Architecture.jpg "GaitAnimator Architecture")

"GaitAnimator" was a UE4-based application for body area network research, supporting
custom external data sources. The application was developed during a 2.5 months
visiting researcher period at TokyoTech under the supervision of
[Prof. Takahiro Aoyagi][2].

## "Euphrosyne" and "Red Thread of Fate"

Started as a final Master's project, "Euphrosyne" was a portable emotive status sensor
capable of tracking the pleasure and arousal dimensions of the PAD emotion
classification model, using skin conductivity and heart rate as physiological
indicators. It was using a custom skin conductivity sensor and a basic
photoplethysmograph. It was also my first soldering project ever.

The prototype was then proposed to be used in a sub-project called
[Red Thread of Fate][1].

## "OHR" and "Radiant Square"

![alt text](/assets/images/OHR_Gameplay_smaller.jpg "OHR and Radiant Square gameplay")

Game and physical controller prototypes created together with Adriano Siesser, Andrea
Conci, Raul Masu and Zeno Menestrina. "OHR" is a game created to explore different
modalities of play, both classical and tangible, powered by Unity3D and a custom-built
hardware interface called "Radiant Square (Radiant2)". I participated in every phase of
the creation of the project, focusing on game design, interaction with the game artist,
physical prototype design and feeling, paper writing and presentation.

The project won the Jury Prize at the Student Game Competition of [CHI Play 2014][4]. A
video presentation of the game prototype can be [watched here][6].

## "City Spirits" and "Magnum Opus"

"City Spirits", and its evolution "Magum Opus", was a research project on long-term
behavioural change through gaming. It involved urban ethnography, user research, focus
groups, and cognitive science research.

Both the games aimed at motivating people to walk more by first providing an external
motivation, while aiming to internalize the motivation by make the players interact with
the world around them.

The game had [strong theory foundations][5], but it was left incomplete once I left the
PhD.

## "Bisoux"

Project created for the [Games [4Design] Jam][2] at [CHI'13][3] in a team. It's a physical
controller based game that helped people getting accustomed to the way of greeting in
France: each player wore a "pendant", an Arduino board with batteries and a red LED
Matrix, and two "kiss sensors" on their cheeks. The target was to go around the
conference floor to greet people by touching both cheeks. Each time the greeting was
done correctly a big pixel-art heart would fill. The first player to fill the heart was
the winner. I worked on the game design and the implementation of the game.

## "Terraforma"

"Terraforma" is a game I made with [Nicolas Silva][1] in Unity3D for the course
"Introduction to Computer Game Prototyping" at Technical University of Denmark. It's a
stealth game with physics-based combat system. The player character cannot attack
directly the enemies and has to either navigate wihout being seen or neutralize the
enemies using her terrain manipulation powers to lower or raise the ground. Features a
dynamic water level system, an enemy area of operations editor for level creation and
2.5D graphics.

## High school projects

High school was a strange time: I had a few friends that were into strange self-made
paper games and they were playing them through lessons or during time off.

I helped them adding new stuff to those games, then I helped testing an implementation
in Visual Basic of one of these games, "Road to Al Capone".

Together we tried to make a survival game based on the real geometry of our school,
creating a converter from CAD models to FBX. I worked more on the game design and on
the story.

Together with one of these friends I made a small, silly, RPGMaker game called "Medievo
2013".

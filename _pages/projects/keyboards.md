## "Scarborough Fair"

My first custom mechanical keyboard, also my first ortholinear keyboard, as well as
my first split keyboard. This was both a blast to make and a tour de force. Due to my
inexperience I had to resolder some switches and the underglow system multiple times
during the months after I soldered it. A big thanks goes to both [Andrew Huie][1] and
[Jeffrey Xiao][2] for their help with this. I was ready to flip tables.

This board allowed me to leave behind the (pretty bad) Cherry MX Greens I liked to start
using the real clicky switches: _the NovelKeys Thick Clicks Box Navies_.

[Here is the build log.][3]

## "Vaporblade"

When I saw [MiTo's GMK Laser keyset][4] I knew I wanted it. I didn't quite know where
to put that but I needed something that would allow me to have that Cyberpunk aesthetic.

Once I received the keyset I decided to go for a very simple DZ60 60% keyboard PCB,
however the cases provided by the same company didn't satisfy me so I bought a
KPrepublic 60% case with tempered glass bottom. I really like how it turned out and it
was my home "driver" for more than a year.

[Here is the build log.][5]

## "Jehuty"

Japan is the land of strange custom split keyboards. That's why, when I started feeling
nostalgic for some numbers on the "Scarborough Fair" I decided to go to [Yushakobo][6]
in Akihabara and buy an [ErgoDash by omkbd][7].

It still uses Box navies as switches, but sports an SA greenscreen keycaps set.

## ORBIT

Speaking of Japanese keyboard designers, my current (as of May 2020) driver is an
extremely sturdy, slick looking [Polaris by Ai03][9].

Building this keyboard took some time because I decided to lube all the Durock T1
switches. Thanks to the switches, the build of the case, and the isolation foam, this
keyboard sounds great!

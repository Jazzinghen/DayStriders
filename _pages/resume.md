## Experience

### Ascent Robotics — Senior Software Engineer

**Ebisu, Tokyo (Japan)**\
_November 2017 ~ Present_

- Involved in the design and development of a 3D simulator in Unreal Engine 4 for
  autonomous driving R&D, used by the company research team to train and validate
  autonomous driving models in a distributed environment.
- Integrated RPC and MSGpack in the simulator to allow external control of the
  simulation, used also in the sister project for robotics simulation, effectively
  providing a remote interface for all in-house simulators
- Handled multi platform deployment of the simulator, while also maintaining the CI
  pipeline, allowing it to be used on both Windows and Linux.
- Lead a 4 person team for a scenario generation project for distributed adversary
  training, managing work between two technical artists and two software engineers
- Handled fixing, automatization, containerization and CI for a semantic map importing
  pipeline for an OpenSource simulator, removing all manual steps for internal
  distribution of ML training and validation maps

### FLIR Integrated Imaging Solutions — Software Developer, C++

**Trento (Italy)**\
_July 2015 ~ October 2017_

- Developed a multiplatform application using Qt 5.7 to demonstrate the capabilities of
  FLIR’s Triclops SDK for stereo camera interfacing and depth computation, using OpenGL
  for point cloud visualization
- Released a new major version of Triclops SDK by integrating OpenCV in stereo
  techniques, reimplementing core routines in Intel SIMD, and improving the company’s
  stereo process speed by 22% and valid disparity pixel by 28%
- Overhauled build system, cutting the build time by almost a half, and standardized
  packaging to the official Debian guidelines
- Tested multiple stereo-based depth reconstruction algorithms on PC and assisted in\
  their deployment on an FPGA SoC for a smart camera product

### University of Trento — PhD Student

**Trento (Italy)**\
_November 2012 ~ June 2015_

- Computer Architecture teaching assistant, handled all practical content of the course,
  wrote teaching material, prepared and graded exams for 150 students/year
- Visiting Junior Researcher at Tokyo Institute of Technology, developed a prototype in
  Unreal Engine 4 for body-area network motion tracking data rendering

## Education

### University of Trento — M.Sc. Computer Science
